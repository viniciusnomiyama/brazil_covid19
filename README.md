# brazil_covid19
A simple representation of the current situation Brazil is facing against the pandemic disease. 

Python libraries needed to run this script:
numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, geopandas.
Please let me know if there is any other visualization that could be interesting, I am looking forward to trying it out to make the graphs better arranged and visually appealing.
